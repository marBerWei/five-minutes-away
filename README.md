### Overview
  As they say in the real estate business making smart  property investments is all about “location location location.” But real estate professionals often find it difficult to know if a particular property is well situated just by browsing online.
  
  That’s where 5 Minutes Away comes in. The tool is designed to help real estate professionals understand whether a property is suitable using the location of nearby banks and coffee shops as proxies for convenience.
  
  Users simply enter any address, and google's auto-complete API fills in the rest of the information. Then, a fetch request is made based on that data to the FourSquare API to find top rated banks and coffee shops nearby.

  The results page displays up to five locations that are either five minutes away by walking or by driving.

  The locations of nearby banks and coffee shops are ordered by popularity.
